# Traceability Driver

The Traceability Driver is a service that can be installed into an existing Traceability Solution or any software that stores or needs to receive traceability data.

## Cross-Platform
The Traceability Driver is written in .NET 5 and will be upgraded to .NET 6 upon it's release in November 2021. The driver is meant to be able to be installed on either a Windows, Linux, or Mac machine.

## Mapper
At the core of the Traceability Driver is your mapper. Your mapper is what takes your local data format and converts it into the common C# models provided. Your mapper should be written in C# and implements the `ITETraceabilityMapper` interface provided in the `TEInterfaces.dll` provided in installation package.
